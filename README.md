# Streams Processing Hands-on Lab

This GitHub Repository contains all of the assets and instructions for the Cloudera Streams Processing Hands on Lab.  

Learn how Cloudera Streaming Analytics (CSA) can help with a myriad of real-world event streaming use cases. Attendees will get hands-on with CSA, and write SQL queries that enable real-time streaming pipelines powered by Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Apache Kudu, and Apache Iceberg. 

During this session, we will create data sources, starting with simple SQL statements, and work up to a full-fledged stream pipeline. We will guide you step by step, provide answers to your questions, and lead you to stream processing with SQL nirvana!

## Lab Highlights

- Use SQL Stream Builder to define tables as sources and sinks using DDL statements.
- Execute a job, correct errors, and monitor running jobs and performance which will run in Apache Flink
- Create an end-to-end stream processor using SQL.
- Pull data from Kafka and push data to Kafka from the interface
- Use SQL Stream Builder to test new features with Apache Iceberg
